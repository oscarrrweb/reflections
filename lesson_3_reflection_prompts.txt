When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share your work to public.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To make sure you always have updated files if working in collaboration.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: A "clone" in Github, cannot modify original repository
Clone: copy a repository locally
Branch: seperate branch from master for tests, bug fixes, etc
