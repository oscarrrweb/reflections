How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

You can see the previous and current version together.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You can easily restore/replace unwanted changes, trace bugs or just refer back toolder work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pro: whenever you want or feel the need to commit
Con: Smaller, more frequent commits creates a large history

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Files may be interrelated in the same commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log to see the list of commits, git diff to see the changes between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I could easily revert those changes if things go wrong

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For version control, DUH!
